# SQLDelight

SQLDelight generates typesafe APIs from your SQL statements. It compile-time verifies your schema, statements, and migrations and provides IDE features like autocomplete and refactoring which make writing and maintaining SQL simple. SQLDelight currently supports the SQLite dialect and there are supported SQLite drivers on Android, JVM, iOS, and Windows.

See the [project website](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/) for documentation and APIs
